19:09 <bboe> Hey
19:10 <bboe> So basically you want to do a git rebase -i master
19:10 <bboe> assuming your master branch tracks the remote master
19:10 <bboe> then you want to tell it to squash all the commits (except for the top most)
19:11 <sente> heya
19:11 <bboe> after doing that you should have 1 single commit
19:11 <bboe> you can verify via `git log`
19:11 <bboe> if the log message is not what you wanted it to be then you can rebase again as before
19:11 <bboe> this time instead of specifying 'squash' you can use the reword or whatever 'r' argument stands for
19:11 <sente> http://c.sente.cc/6QFI/git-lol.txt
19:11 <bboe> and provide a new commit message
19:11 <sente> yeah
