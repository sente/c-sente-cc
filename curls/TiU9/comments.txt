Missing a year of my son's life isn't worth ten times that much.\n\n**EDIT:** Just feel the urge to answer some of the cheeky comments seriously.\n\nA million dollars is a lot of money, but wouldn't give me the chance to suddenly retire and live luxuriously. ten or 100 mill definitely would, so let's look at that number.\n\nFor ten million, I'd still say no, because I would rather spend the time with my family than suffer the damage that a year away would cause. And once I've said no to 10 million (enough to keep us living comfortably for the rest of our lives, doing what we want), then 100 million is actually no different. Yeah, it's MUCH MUCH MORE MONEY! But it wouldn't change what I want to do with my life, which could all easily be accomplished with 10 mill.\n",

Reddit is manipulable, especially with swarm trolling. Sad but true.\n\nI'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing and posting the humorous content that I do. I do it for me and for my entertainment and not for karma or Reddit response. Again, the trolls can do whatever the fuck they want while I ream them over and over again in a game they cheat at.

Plus I couldn't do that to my girlfriend who knows what the effects would be on our relationship even if she didn't give up hope within that year. Tie it all down with the fact that you'd have to either squirrel away the money and not tell anyone (otherwise you'd probably need to claim it as a gift on your taxes and get absolutely raped by the government) and I just don't think this is a reasonable amount of money to offer in return for what's being asked.

If I disappeared, I dunno if she could cope. \n\nFor three, my boyfriend's dad would pretty much make my boyfriend get a new girlfriend. For some reason, his dad thinks that a dude's worth is completely determined by whether or not he has a girlfriend, and how hot she is... so if a dude is single or is dating an unattractive girl, he has no self respect.\n\nFor four, I have no social life.
